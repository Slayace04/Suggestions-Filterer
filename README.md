# Suggestions-Filterer
This script will basically take suggestions and put them into a queue (Discord Channel), if the suggestion is denied / approved, it will be removed from the queue
if the suggestion is updated to "considered", the bot will move the suggestion from the normal queue to the "considered" queue
once the suggestion is updated from considered to denied or approved, the bot will remove the suggestion from the considered queue.
You need Carl-bot's suggestion system for this to work (Check out Carl-bot over here https://carl.gg)  
-
Keep in mind that you need to host (Discord Bot) this yourself 
This is just the script
-
How Do I use this?
Just replace the "0"s with your channel IDs (Line 9, 10 & 11), Bot Token (Link 7 & 59) & Carl-bot's User ID (Line 8)  
-
We've added a python version, you will find it in the main folder "bot.py"
