# Suggestions-Filterer
This script will basically take suggestions and put them in a queue (Discord Channel), if the suggestion is denied / approved, it will be removed from the queue
if the suggestion is updated to "considered", the bot would move the suggestion from the normal queue to the "considered" queue
once the suggestion is updated from considered to denied or approved, the bot will remove the suggestion from the queue.
You need Carlbot's suggestion system for this to work (Check out Carlbot over here https://carl.gg)
